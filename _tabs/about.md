Hi there! My name is Bailee, and I have been working as a SOC analyst and Incident Responder. I wanted to put together a site containing all of the things I have learned and written down over the years. 

So if you're interested in cyber defense, log analysis, incident response, or even some (okay, a lot of) cloud (AWS and Azure) offense & defense, youâ€™re in the right place! 

Check out the [categories page]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/) to see what I'm up to now. 

### Feel free to connect with me:
- on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baileemcbreairty/)
- and on Discord (my username is @**Prlme**)
